reactbox.js

Trully responsive lightbox that fits on mobile devices.
The problem of the current lightboxes is that when you are on a mobile phone, and you click on a image to see a bigger version of it, you can't, because you get limited by the screen size.
With reactbox the image overflows the device screen, allowing the user to scroll and zoom in or out through the picture.
